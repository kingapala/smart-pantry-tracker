# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # start dev server (Astro SSR + Cloudflare adapter)
npm run build        # production build — requires SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_KEY env vars
npm run lint         # ESLint across .ts, .tsx, .astro
npm run lint:fix     # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run format       # Prettier on all files
npx astro sync       # regenerate type declarations (run before build if types are stale)
```

Pre-commit hook (husky + lint-staged) runs ESLint on `.ts/.tsx/.astro` and Prettier on `.json/.css/.md` automatically.

## Architecture

**Stack**: Astro 6 (SSR) + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + Supabase + Cloudflare Pages

All pages are server-rendered (`output: "server"` in [astro.config.mjs](astro.config.mjs)) — there is no static export mode.

**Directory layout**:

- `src/pages/` — Astro page routes (`.astro`) and API routes (`src/pages/api/**/*.ts`)
- `src/components/` — Astro components (`.astro`) and React components (`.tsx`)
- `src/layouts/` — Astro layout wrappers
- `src/lib/` — shared utilities; `supabase.ts` is the Supabase client factory

**Import alias**: `@/` maps to `src/` throughout the project.

## Key Conventions

**Env vars must use `astro:env/server`**, not `process.env` or `import.meta.env`. The schema is declared in `astro.config.mjs` under `env.schema`. Adding a new server secret requires adding it there first.

**Supabase client is per-request and nullable**. `createClient()` in [src/lib/supabase.ts](src/lib/supabase.ts) returns `null` when `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` are not set. Every caller must null-check the result before use.

**Auth context flows through `Astro.locals.user`**. Middleware ([src/middleware.ts](src/middleware.ts)) calls `supabase.auth.getUser()` and stores the result in `context.locals.user` (typed in [src/env.d.ts](src/env.d.ts)). Page components read `Astro.locals.user` — they do not call Supabase directly for auth state.

**Route protection is declared in middleware**. Add protected paths to the `PROTECTED_ROUTES` array in [src/middleware.ts](src/middleware.ts); unauthenticated requests are redirected to `/auth/signin`.

**API routes communicate errors via URL query params**, not JSON. On error, routes redirect back to the form page with `?error=<encoded-message>` appended; pages read `Astro.url.searchParams.get("error")` to surface it. See [src/pages/api/auth/signin.ts](src/pages/api/auth/signin.ts) as the canonical example.

**Fetch-driven API routes return 401 on missing auth**, not a redirect. Routes called via `fetch()` (never navigated to directly) should return `new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 })` when `context.locals.user` is absent. Form-submission routes (navigated via `<form action="...">`) may redirect to `/auth/signin` instead. The distinction matters because `fetch()` treats any 2xx/3xx as `response.ok = true`, so a redirect would silently appear successful to the client script.

**All dates are UTC; use `formatDate()` / `nowUTC()` from `@/lib/date.ts`**, never bare `new Date().toISOString()`, `toLocaleDateString()`, or any implicit-timezone call. For UI display use `formatDateDisplay()` from the same module — it always passes `timeZone: "UTC"` to `Intl.DateTimeFormat` so the rendered date cannot shift based on the server's or user's locale.

## Business Logic

The shopping list is auto-derived from inventory state: a product appears on the shopping list when `current_quantity < min_threshold` **and** its `addToList` flag is `true` (default ON). The list is a live reflection — no manual curation. Data isolation per user is enforced by Supabase Row-Level Security; never bypass RLS with service-role key for user-facing queries.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 2, Lesson 5

Scale the single-change cycle into parallel work with **worktrees, goal-directed delegation, and multi-session orchestration**:

```
worktree per change -> /goal or claude -p -> PR -> review -> merge
```

The lesson focus is safe throughput: isolated contexts, choosing the right execution mode, and capping parallelism at review capacity.

### Task Router - Where to start

| Skill                                                   | Use it when                                                                                                                                  |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Code isolation**                                      |                                                                                                                                              |
| `git worktree add`                                      | You need a separate working directory for a parallel change. One change per worktree, one fresh agent context per worktree.                  |
| **Complex changes**                                     |                                                                                                                                              |
| `/10x-implement <change-id> phase <n>`                  | The change has multiple phases, needs manual gates, or benefits from interactive decision-making during execution.                           |
| **Simple changes**                                      |                                                                                                                                              |
| `/goal`                                                 | You have a clear, bounded task and want goal-directed delegation. The agent works autonomously toward the stated goal with a stop condition. |
| `claude -p`                                             | You want headless execution for a well-defined task. The Ralph Wiggum loop (run, check, retry) is the universal autonomous pattern.          |
| **Multi-session orchestration**                         |                                                                                                                                              |
| Superset / Conductor / Antigravity / VS Code Agent View | You are running multiple agent sessions in parallel and need visibility, coordination, or session management across them.                    |

### Parallel work rules

- One change per worktree or isolated workspace. One fresh agent context per change.
- Choose interactive `/10x-implement` for complex changes, `/goal` or `claude -p` for simple ones.
- Parallelism is capped by review capacity. More agents without review means more unreviewed code, not higher throughput.
- The quality pain from faster shipping is intentional — it bridges into Module 3 testing gates.

### Lesson boundaries

- Do not reteach interactive `/10x-implement` or `/10x-impl-review`; those are Lessons 2 and 3.
- Do not introduce testing strategy here. The quality pain is the motivation for Module 3.
- Worktrees are a mechanism for isolation, not the topic of a full git tutorial.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `context/changes/<change-id>/` - active change folder
- `context/changes/<change-id>/plan.md` - implementation input for any execution mode

Skills must not write to `context/archive/`. Archived changes are immutable; if a resolved target path starts with `context/archive/`, abort with: "This change is archived. Open a new change with `/10x-new` instead."
