# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Commands

```bash
npm run dev          # start dev server (Astro SSR + Cloudflare adapter)
npm run build        # production build — requires SUPABASE_URL + SUPABASE_KEY env vars
npm run lint         # ESLint across .ts, .tsx, .astro
npm run lint:fix     # ESLint with auto-fix
npm run format       # Prettier on all files
npx astro sync       # regenerate type declarations (run before build if types are stale)
```

Pre-commit hook (husky + lint-staged) runs ESLint on `.ts/.tsx/.astro` and Prettier on `.json/.css/.md` automatically.

## Architecture

**Stack**: Astro 6 (SSR) + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS 4 + Supabase + Cloudflare Pages

All pages are server-rendered (`output: "server"` in [astro.config.mjs](astro.config.mjs)) — there is no static export mode.

**Directory layout**:

- `src/pages/` — Astro page routes (`.astro`) and API routes (`src/pages/api/**/*.ts`)
- `src/components/` — Astro components (`.astro`) and React components (`.tsx`)
- `src/layouts/` — Astro layout wrappers
- `src/lib/` — shared utilities; `supabase.ts` is the Supabase client factory

**Import alias**: `@/` maps to `src/` throughout the project.

## Key Conventions

**Env vars must use `astro:env/server`**, not `process.env` or `import.meta.env`. The schema is declared in `astro.config.mjs` under `env.schema`. Adding a new server secret requires adding it there first.

**Supabase client is per-request and nullable**. `createClient()` in [src/lib/supabase.ts](src/lib/supabase.ts) returns `null` when `SUPABASE_URL`/`SUPABASE_KEY` are not set. Every caller must null-check the result before use.

**Auth context flows through `Astro.locals.user`**. Middleware ([src/middleware.ts](src/middleware.ts)) calls `supabase.auth.getUser()` and stores the result in `context.locals.user` (typed in [src/env.d.ts](src/env.d.ts)). Page components read `Astro.locals.user` — they do not call Supabase directly for auth state.

**Route protection is declared in middleware**. Add protected paths to the `PROTECTED_ROUTES` array in [src/middleware.ts](src/middleware.ts); unauthenticated requests are redirected to `/auth/signin`.

**API routes communicate errors via URL query params**, not JSON. On error, routes redirect back to the form page with `?error=<encoded-message>` appended; pages read `Astro.url.searchParams.get("error")` to surface it. See [src/pages/api/auth/signin.ts](src/pages/api/auth/signin.ts) as the canonical example.

**Fetch-driven API routes return 401 on missing auth**, not a redirect. Routes called via `fetch()` (never navigated to directly) should return `new Response("Unauthorized", { status: 401 })` when `context.locals.user` is absent. Form-submission routes (navigated via `<form action="...">`) may redirect to `/auth/signin` instead. The distinction matters because `fetch()` treats any 2xx/3xx as `response.ok = true`, so a redirect would silently appear successful to the client script.

**All dates are UTC; use `formatDate()` / `nowUTC()` from `@/lib/date.ts`**, never bare `new Date().toISOString()`, `toLocaleDateString()`, or any implicit-timezone call. For UI display use `formatDateDisplay()` from the same module — it always passes `timeZone: "UTC"` to `Intl.DateTimeFormat` so the rendered date cannot shift based on the server's or user's locale.

## Business Logic

The shopping list is auto-derived from inventory state: a product appears on the shopping list when `current_quantity < min_threshold` **and** its `addToList` flag is `true` (default ON). The list is a live reflection — no manual curation. Data isolation per user is enforced by Supabase Row-Level Security; never bypass RLS with service-role key for user-facing queries.

## 10xDevs AI Toolkit - Module 3, Lesson 3

Lesson 3 is about **hooks** — turning the quality gates from Lesson 1 and the tests from Lesson 2 into automatic, deterministic checks that fire while the agent works. A hook runs outside the model, so it survives context compression, instruction changes, and the model "forgetting". The payoff for agentic hooks specifically: a `PostToolUse` check can feed its result back into the agent's context, so the agent fixes trivial errors (formatting, a missing import, a wrong type) on its own in the next iteration instead of you discovering them minutes later.

```

   per-edit (agent hooks)  →  pre-commit (git hooks)  →  pre-push  →  CI

        ▼
   exit code + stdout  →  additionalContext  →  agent reacts next turn
```

### Task Router — Which layer for this check

| You want to | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| React the instant the agent edits a file | A per-edit hook (`PostToolUse` matcher `Write\|Edit` in Claude Code). Right for fast checks: lint/format, and scoped tests on risk-area files. This is the **only** layer that can hand feedback to the agent mid-session. |
| Run only the tests that depend on the edited file | Parse the path from the hook's stdin (`jq -r .tool_input.file_path`) and run your runner's related-tests mode (`vitest related "$FILE" --run`, `jest --findRelatedTests $FILE`). Gate it on whether the file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`; don't run tests on every helper or config edit. |
| Catch changes that bypassed the agent (manual edits, a teammate's commit) | A pre-commit git hook (Lefthook or Husky+lint-staged) over staged files: lint + typecheck, and tests on staged risk files. |
| Run heavier checks before code leaves the machine | Pre-push: full typecheck or a broader test set. Anything too slow for per-edit moves here. |
| Decide where a given gate belongs | Ask: is it fast enough (a few seconds) for per-edit, or should it wait for commit/push/CI? Slow checks block the agent loop on every edit — push them up a layer. |
| Use the same hook across tools | The trigger → matcher → handler → signal pattern is the same in Cursor, Codex, Windsurf, and Copilot; only the config file and event names change. See the cross-tool table below. |

### Hook lifecycle — the universal pattern

Every tool's hooks follow four steps:

1. **Trigger** — an event in the tool (e.g. the agent just saved a file: `PostToolUse`).
2. **Matcher** — a filter deciding whether this hook runs (tool name like `Write`/`Edit`, file type, or a name pattern).
3. **Handler** — the action that runs, usually a shell command.
4. **Signal** — the result returns to the tool. The exit code says pass/fail; stdout can flow into the agent's context as feedback.

### Exit codes and the feedback loop

- **0** — success; the hook passed, continue.
- **2** — blocking error; the agent sees the feedback and should react.
- **anything else** — non-blocking error; logged, but does not interrupt work.

On a blocking failure, stdout flows into the agent's context (in Claude Code via `additionalContext`, capped at 10,000 characters; other tools have similar mechanisms with their own limits). That is why the agent can self-correct: it sees the concrete message — missing type, unimported module, badly formatted line — not just "something failed".

The boundary: the agent reliably fixes **trivial** corrections on its own. When a test fails because of wrong business logic, the hook surfaces it but the agent may not diagnose the real cause — it says "something is off" and tries a trivial fix. If that does not resolve in one or two tries, the signal comes back to you, and the problem may deserve its own change-id with the full `/10x-new → /10x-research → /10x-plan → /10x-implement` workflow.

### Three local layers (plus CI)

| Layer | Catches | Timing |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Per-edit (agent hooks) | Formatting, simple type errors, failing unit tests on risk files. Only layer that feeds the agent mid-work. | ms–s |
| Pre-commit (git hooks) | What slipped past per-edit: manual edits, files changed outside the hook, checks too slow for per-edit. Operates on staged files. | s |
| Pre-push | Heavier checks before pushing to remote (full typecheck, broader test set). | s–min |
| CI | Integration problems, cross-module dependencies, checks needing infra unavailable locally. | min |

Local layers do **not** replace CI — CI stays the key verification for shared repo state and environments you don't control. But each local layer that catches an error is one fewer CI round-trip. You don't need all layers from day one: start with one per-edit hook (lint) and one commit gate, add layers as you see what escapes. The quality gates in `test-plan.md §4` decide which checks are worth automating and when; a plan may legitimately defer per-edit hooks if the cost/signal ratio isn't there yet.

### Key rules

- Keep per-edit hooks fast. If a check takes more than a few seconds, move it to commit, push, or CI — a slow per-edit hook blocks the agent loop on every edit. Lint/format are ideal per-edit; full typecheck is often a commit gate in larger projects.
- Run scoped tests, not the whole suite, per edit — only tests related to the edited file, and only when that file is a risk area in `test-plan.md`.
- `related` is a subcommand, not a flag (`vitest related`, not `--related`). Use `--run` so the hook terminates instead of entering watch mode.
- `PostToolUse` fires once per tool use; three edits in one turn fire it three times independently — there is no built-in aggregation.
- The git hook tool (Lefthook vs Husky+lint-staged) is an implementation detail; the rule is the same — run checks on staged files before commit. If Husky already works, don't migrate.
- **Context injection is not universal.** Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, and Copilot (in VS Code) can pass a hook's result to the agent; Windsurf cannot — it can block (exit 2) but can't tell the agent what went wrong.

### The same pattern in every tool

| Tool | Events | Handlers | Context injection | Config |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | ~30 | command, http, mcp_tool, prompt, agent | yes | `.claude/settings.json` |
| Cursor | ~18 | command, prompt | yes | `.cursor/hooks.json` |
| Codex | 10 | command | yes | `.codex/hooks.json` |
| Windsurf | 12 | command | **no** | `.windsurf/hooks.json` |
| Copilot | ~13 | command, http, prompt | yes (VS Code) | `.github/hooks/*.json` |

### Lesson boundaries

- This lesson configures hooks and local quality layers only. The hook JSON, `lefthook.yml`, and the per-edit/commit/push layering are the scope.
- Do not write E2E tests, configure Playwright/MCP, or run browser scenarios. That is Lesson 4.
- Do not run the bug-to-fix-to-regression-test debugging workflow. That is Lesson 5.
- Do not change the risk strategy or quality-gate definitions. That is Lesson 1 (`/10x-test-plan`); read current state with `/10x-test-plan --status`.
- Do not write unit/integration test code from scratch here. That is Lesson 2 — hooks only *run* the tests those lessons produced.
- Do not author CI/CD pipelines. That is Module 1 Lesson 5 / Module 2 Lesson 5; hooks are the local layers in front of CI.

### Paths used by this lesson

- `.claude/settings.json` — hook configuration (`~/.claude/settings.json` global, `.claude/settings.json` project, `.claude/settings.local.json` local overrides). Other tools use their own config file (see the table).
- `lefthook.yml` — pre-commit git hook config (lint + typecheck + tests on `{staged_files}`).
- `context/foundation/test-plan.md` — §4 quality gates decide which checks to automate and at which layer; risk areas decide which edits warrant scoped tests.
